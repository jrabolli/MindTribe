# you'd have 3 models (user, group, group_user)
# user - you already have but it has the following relationship

belongs_to :group


#------------
# group is a new model with an id, and a name and the following relationship
has_many :group_users
has_many :users :through=>:group_users

# ----------
#group_users is a new model with an id, user_id, group_id
# (basically this is a join table) with the following relationships
belongs_to :user
belongs_to :group



#this is off the top of my head and keep in mind that I'm pretty new.  good luck though
# rails is fun :)
